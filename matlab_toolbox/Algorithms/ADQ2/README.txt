* Description *
***************  
  
this archive includes a Matlab implementation of an algorithm used to detect 
and localize aligned double JPEG compression, as decribed in 
T. Bianchi, A. De Rosa, and A. Piva, "IMPROVED DCT COEFFICIENT ANALYSIS 
FOR FORGERY LOCALIZATION IN JPEG IMAGES", ICASSP 2011, Prague, Czech Republic, 
2011, pp. 2444-2447.

************************
*Component Description *
************************

getJmap.m: produces tampering probability map (main file)
floor2.m: modified floor function
ceil2.m: modified ceil function     
jpeg_rec.m: simulates decompressed JPEG image from JPEG object
demo.m: demo script
README.txt: this file
gpl.txt: GPL license


***********************
* Set-up Instructions *  
***********************

extract all files to a single directory. Add the directory to the Matlab path, 
or set it as the current Matlab directory


********************
* Run Instructions *
********************      

open JPEG image using jpeg_read:

im = jpeg_read(<file_name>);

pass JPEG object to main function:

map = getJmap(im, 1, 1, 15);

the above parameters mean that tampering map is obtained using only Y channel 
(ncomp = 1) and DCT coefficients from 1 to 15 (zig-zag ordering).

Run demo.m for a simple example


**********************
* Output Description *
**********************

The algorithm returns a map giving the probability of being tampered. Values
close to zero indicate high probability of double JPEG. Values close to one
indicate high probability of single JPEG. If double JPEG is not present map
should be close to 0.5.
