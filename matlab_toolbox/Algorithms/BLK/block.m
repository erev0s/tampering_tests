function [doctored, pro]=block(image)
% This code, and all m-files called by it, was provided by 
% Dr Weihai Li, whli@ustc.edu.cn, and is the original implementation
% of the algorithm described in:
% Li, Weihai, Yuan Yuan, and Nenghai Yu. "Passive detection of doctored JPEG 
% image via block artifact grid extraction." Signal Processing 89, no. 9 (2009): 
% 1821-1829.
%
% This code is left here as legacy and reference to the original authors.
% We have written a different implementation using this code as a guide.
% Without loss of performance, we have significantly reduced running 
% times. Our implementation is in GetBlockGrid.m and was the one used in
% our evaluations.

% If you use this code please cite the aforementioned paper and notify both us
