***********************
* Set-up Instructions *  
***********************

extract all files to a single directory. Add the directory to the Matlab path, 
or set it as the current Matlab directory


********************
* Run Instructions *
********************      

open JPEG image using jpeg_read:

im = jpeg_read(<file_name>);

pass JPEG object to main function:

[map, map_s, q1, k1e, k2e] = getJmapNA_EM(im, 1, 6);

(use similar syntax for getJmap_EM)

the above parameters mean that tampering map(s) are obtained using only Y channel 
(ncomp = 1), DCT coefficients from 1 to 6 (zig-zag ordering).
The parameters for the EM algorithm are the same used in the TIFS paper.
map is computed using standard model, map_s is computed using simplified model.

map_final = smooth_unshift(sum(map,3), k1e, k2e);

final map is obtained by cumulating the likelihood maps of all DCT coeffs.
q1 is the estimated quantization matrix of first compression.
k1e, k2e is the estimated shift.

Run demo.m for more examples


**********************
* Output Description *
**********************

The algorithm returns a map giving the likelihood of being doubly JPEG compressed.
The algorithm also returns the estimated quantization matrix of first compression,
and the shift in the case of NA-DJPG. If double JPEG is not present map should be 
close to 0.5.
