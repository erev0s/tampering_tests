function mid=Mid_Value(a)
% This code was provided by Dr Weihai Li, whli@ustc.edu.cn, and is the
% original implementation of the algorithm described in:
% Li, Weihai, Yuan Yuan, and Nenghai Yu. "Passive detection of doctored JPEG 
% image via block artifact grid extraction." Signal Processing 89, no. 9 (2009): 
% 1821-1829.
%
% We have written a different implementation using this code as a
% guide. Without loss of performance, we have significantly reduced running
% times. Our implementation is in GetBlockGrid.m
