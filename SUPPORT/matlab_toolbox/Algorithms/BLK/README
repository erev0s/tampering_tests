While the code used in this framework (contained in GetBlockGrid.m) was written
by us for reasons of computational efficiency, the original author has also
provided their own implementation. It is contained in block.m, and further

* Description *
***************  

This package includes a Matlab implementation of an algorithm used to detect 
the presence of discontinuities in JPEG blocking artifacts, as decribed in:

Li, Weihai, Yuan Yuan, and Nenghai Yu. "Passive detection of doctored JPEG 
image via block artifact grid extraction." Signal Processing 89, no. 9 (2009): 
1821-1829.

If you use the code for academic purposes, you should cite the aforementioned 
work.

A demo script and a sample image are included.

************
* Platform *
************      

Written and tested on Matlab 8.3.0.532 (R2014a) 
It is likely that it will work on older versions.
