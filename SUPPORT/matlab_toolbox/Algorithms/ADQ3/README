* Description *
***************  

this package includes a Matlab implementation of an algorithm used to detect 
the presence of aligned double JPEG compression, as decribed in:

Amerini, Irene, Rudy Becarelli, Roberto Caldelli, and Andrea Del Mastio. 
"Splicing forgeries localization through the use of first digit features." 
In Information Forensics and Security (WIFS), 2014 IEEE International 
Workshop on, pp. 143-148. IEEE, 2014.
